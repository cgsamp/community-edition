title: Orphaning
---

When a package no longer has any Owners and/or Maintainers, it is considered orphaned. This could be because the Owners and Maintainers are unable, or unwilling, to continue their responsibilities.

If the package continues to have value to Tanzu Community Edition, ownership will fall to the Community. Maintenance by the Community will be a best effort until a new Owner and Maintainers can be found.

If an orphaned packaged continues to have no Owner or Maintainers for XXX PERIOD OF TIME, the Tanzu Community Edition Engineering team will make an assessment if the package should be considered for retirement.

Should a package be orphaned, other interested parties are welcome to take ownership and continue maintenance duties.
