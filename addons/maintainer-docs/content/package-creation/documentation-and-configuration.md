title: Documentation and Configuration
---

## Documentation

This should include a brief overview of the software components contained in the package, a description of configuration parameters, and general usage information. This documentation is not inteneded to replace, or be as extensive as the official documentation for the software.

The package documentation should highlight dependencies or considerations on other packages, software, Kubernetes distributions, or underlying infrastructure (e.g. AWS, GCP, Docker, vSphere, etc).

## Configuration Parameters

Configurable options should be documented in the schema.yaml file. Here is an example...

```yaml
- schema
  - schema
    - schema
```
