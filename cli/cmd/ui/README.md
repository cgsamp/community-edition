# UI

`ui` is a proof-of-concept for trying out user interface ideas for Tanzu
Community Edition. This is not an official project within TCE and anything in
this tree may be removed completely when done.

## Building

To build the UI plugin, from the root of this repo run the `make build-ui-plugin`
command. This will produce a binary in `artifacts/${OS}-${ARCH}/Valet`.
