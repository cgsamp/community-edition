title: Submitting a Package to TCE

### Opening a Proposal (GitHub Issue)

To submit a package for consideration into TCE's package repository, you will need to create a GitHub Issue. The issue should provide details about:

* Functionality it provides
* Software involved
* TODO (joshrosso)

**highly recommended:** Wait for `status/approved` on proposal before doing work. You're welcome to begin work immediately, but if the proposal is `status/declined`, the work may go to waste.
